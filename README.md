# angst-http-server

I did this to study multithreading and socket programming in cpp. Also a way to avoid things I should focus on irl :)
Hopefully, I would be able to write up my learning from this in my non existent blog.

## Features
- [x] Accept connections
- [x] Parse incoming HTTP request messages
- [x] Handle GET and HEAD HTTP methods
- [x] Ability to send Response header and payload
- [x] Concurrent request handling using worker threads. 

## Known issues
- [ ] Only support HTTP 1.1
- [ ] HTTP request and URI parsing is purely experiemental
